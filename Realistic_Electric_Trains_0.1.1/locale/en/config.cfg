[message]
ret-connect-failure=Cannot connect overhead line
ret-connect-failure-curve=Curve requires closer poles
ret-connect-failure-distance=__1__ tile(s) too far away

[mod-setting-name]
ret-enable-connect-particles=Enable connection particles
ret-enable-failure-text=Enable connection failure text
ret-enable-zigzag-wire=Enable zigzag wire
ret-enable-zigzag-vertical-only=Zigzag only on vertical rails
ret-enable-circuit-wire=Enable automatic circuit wires
ret-enable-rewire-neighbours=Enable rewiring of neighbours
ret-max-pole-search-distance=Maximum additional search distance

[mod-setting-description]
ret-enable-connect-particles=If enabled, red and green particles will show if rails become powered or unpowered.
ret-enable-failure-text=If enabled, a message text will pop up if two overhead line poles could not be connected.
ret-enable-zigzag-wire=If enabled, the wire will be moved left and right on straight rails to mimic the zigzag pattern that overhead lines in real life use. This has no ingame effect other than aesthetics. Does not affect existing wires.
ret-enable-zigzag-vertical-only=Only enable the zigzag wire for vertical rails. This is useful, as the wires in Factorio normally "hang" a bit, which makes zigzag lines on horizontal or diagonal rails useless. Does not affect existing wires.
ret-enable-circuit-wire=If enabled, red and green circuit wires are automatically installed between adjacent poles. Can be used to compensate for the fact that blueprinted circuit wires are unfortunately not retained. Does not affect existing poles.
ret-enable-rewire-neighbours=If enabled, neighbours of newly placed poles will be rewired. This fixes some weird wiring patterns, but takes more processing time. Does not affect existing poles.
ret-max-pole-search-distance=The additional distance checked when searching for overhead line poles. A higher value gives more accurate distances in the failure message. A lower value might increase performance during building.
